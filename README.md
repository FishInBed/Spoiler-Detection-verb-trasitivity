# Spoiler-Detection-verb-trasitivity
This is a project attempting to detect the spoiler posts on social medium with machine learning approaches.
The data from the movie board of PTT was used in this study.
With SVM and Logistic Regression as the models and verb transitivity as the linguistic feature, the recall turned out to reach 0.95 for the Logistic Regression model.
As a result, the linguistic feature, verb transitivity, is proved to be useful for models to detect spoiler posts for people on social medium.
